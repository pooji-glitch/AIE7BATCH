For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation.

            "\n",
            "### 1. For Loop\n",
            "The `for` loop is commonly used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Using a for loop to iterate through a list\n",
            "items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
            "for item in items:\n",
            "    print(item)\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. While Loop\n",
            "The `while` loop runs as long as a specified condition is true.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Using a while loop\n",
            "count = 0\n",
            "while count < 5:\n",
            "    print(count)\n",
            "    count += 1\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. Using Range\n",
            "If you want to loop a specific number of times, you can use the `range()` function.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Looping with range()\n",

            "    print(i)\n",

            "\n",

            "\n",
            "### 5. Avoiding Infinite Loops\n",
            "Be careful with while loops to ensure that the condition will eventually become false; otherwise, you may create an infinite loop.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 6. Using `enumerate()`\n",
            "When looping through a list and you need the index, `enumerate()` can be very helpful.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",

            "for index, item in enumerate(items):\n",

            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 7. Loop Control Statements\n",
            "You can use `break`, `continue`, and `pass` to control the flow of your loops.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **`break`:** Exit the loop.\n",
            "- **`continue`:** Skip the current iteration and move to the next one.\n",
            "- **`pass`:** A placeholder that does nothing.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Using break and continue\n",
            "for number in range(10):\n",
